# Icon Ninja

A mod that turns the main menu into Fruit Ninja, by allowing you to swipe to kill icons and making them fly out from the bottom of the screen.

Idea from Alphalaneous, see [this discord message](https://discord.com/channels/911701438269386882/911702535373475870/1303111747539963905)! \
